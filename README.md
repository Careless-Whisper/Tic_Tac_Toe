Tic Tac Toe 

The point of the project is to practice OOP in Ruby.


Two players take turns placing Xs / Os on the board. A player wins if he/she gets 3 in a row. If the board is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.

Instructions
This was writen in Ruby ('2.5.1'), to play it you need Ruby installed on your system.

When the game prompts you to pick a cell to mark. Enter
a number between 1 and 9 based on the grid.

Load the game by navigating to the directory holding the tic_tac.rb file 
on the command line then type: "ruby tic_tac.rb"
